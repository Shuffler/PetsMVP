# PetsMVP
Rewrite for project of Udacity's [Android Basics: Data Storage](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845) course using a more modern Android stack.
You can find the old project [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud845-Pets).
I've choosen this app as a very simple source code for demonstration purposes

### Features:
* This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs.

### Info 
* The app is built using  [MVP (Model View Presenter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) pattern
* JUnite & mockito for tetsing
* Realm as a Reactive database
* Stetho for debugging
